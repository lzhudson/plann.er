# 📝 Overview

Plann.er is a travel planning web app.

Initially, the idea is to enter a destination, the start and end date of the trip and invite your friends. You can register all the activities you're going to do on the trip by entering your name and the date and time so that no one is left out. You can also enter important links such as the link to a particular restaurant, the location of a tourist attraction and finally you can manage your guest list.
